# Azure AI Vision Text Reading Application

This application utilizes the Azure AI Vision API to read text from images, including printed text and handwriting. It provides a simple command-line interface for users to select an image and view the extracted text along with bounding boxes around the detected text.

## Features

- Read printed text from images (e.g., Lincoln.jpg).
- Read handwriting from images (e.g., Note.jpg).
- Display detected text and its bounding polygons on the original image.
- Save the annotated image with detected text as text.jpg.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Azure account with access to the Computer Vision API
- Necessary Python packages


## Example Output

1: Use Read API for image (Lincoln.jpg)

2: Read handwriting (Note.jpg)
